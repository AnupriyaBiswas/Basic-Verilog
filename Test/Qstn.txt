Write a VHDL code to implement this : 
Smart Traffic Light System
States  :
    1. Red -> Stop
    2. Green -> Go
    3. Yellow -> Slow Down
    4. PED_WAIT -> Pedestrian Request
    5. PED_CROSS -> Pedestrian Crossing

Transitions : 
    1. Normal Cycle : Red -> Green -> Yellow -> Red
    2. If pedestrian Presses button, go to PED_WAIT -> PED_CROSS -> RED




1. There should be a total of 5 States - RED, GREEN, YELLOW, PED_WAIT and PED_CROSS
2. The normal cycle is RED -> GREEN -> YELLOW
3. The gtkwave should have 5 lines - red, yellow, green, ped_request, ped_signal.
4. when the pedestrian presses the button, the State changes to PED_WAIT for a little time.During this time, the ped_request signal should be 1.
5. Then, the state changes to PED_CROSS during which the light turns red. During this time, both the ped_signal and the ped_request is 1.
6. The PED_CROSS changes back to RED when the button is pressed again by the pedestrian. During the button press, the ped_request changes to 1 for a short while like before in step 4.
7. The Normal Cycle cotinues.
